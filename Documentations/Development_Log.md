| Nov. 12 2019  | Progressbar  |  One of the significant issues that were encountered in implementing the features is the creation of the Progress Bar. Due to its difficulty, I deliberately thought whether to implement this feature or disregard this from the application. I tried to create and manage my own codes by trying to make several loops which worked but not the way I wanted it to be. I also tried to use the Time method which also worked but had the same outcome. I ended up looking for Ruby gem progress bar instead. |
|  Nov. 19 2019 |  Data management | Another issue that I encountered was manipulating the logic of the application. There are too many data and details to consider for every feature of the application. There was some confusion as to what variables I needed to implement since each monster has the same values but different keys. In order to sort out the issues for this, I tried to partition each process by taking all the variables needed for the first battle and proceed with creating the logic afterwards. Dividing the process allowed me to focus mainly on the variables that I want to manipulate.  |
