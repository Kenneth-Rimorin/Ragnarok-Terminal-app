# User Interaction and Experience

The application is classified as a Role Playing Game (RPG) wherein the player assumes the
roles of the character they play in a fictional setting. The goal of the game is to hunt and defeat
the monsters. The controls and features of the game are taught in an understandable story line
and sequence. The application includes a non-player character that is used to advance the story
line of the game. Through the command feature of the game, the player could also respond to
the speech displayed by the NPC.

The program will implement a feature that allows the user to input the name for its player. The
name has to be at least four characters long, otherwise the application will prompt the same
question. Another key feature of the game is the Job class selection. The game offers an
opportunity for the user to choose his desired Job for the character he opt to use. The game
provides three job options; 1=Swordsman, 2=Acolyte, and 3=Archer. The user has to select
from 1 to 3, however, if the user is unable to pick a number within that range, the game will not
proceed.

The application also implements a feature that will allow the user to select the skills for its
character. Each of the Job classification has particular and distinct set of skills and play style.
The user has to select between the two skills that are displayed. If the user is unable to pick a
number between one and two, the game will prompt the same options until the player pressed
the right option.

The other fun feature of the game is that it also allows the user to type commands. The
application will prompt the user to input a command in order to proceed.

1. Dungeon system – the user needs to type “@warp” in order to move to the dungeon
2.  Inventory system- the user needs to type “@items” in order for the player to access its

inventories, e. Apples to boost the HP
As a general rule, the application will display the same questions if the player press any other
keys or pick a different option that were not displayed the screen.
