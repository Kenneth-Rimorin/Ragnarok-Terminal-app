# Statement of Purpose and Scope

## Application Description
- The application is classified as a Role Playing Game (RPG) wherein the player needs to battle
against monsters. There is a story line incorporated on the game wherein the monster should
all be hunted and defeated by the player to bring peace to the town and to its people. The
structure of the game is quite similar to that of an action type of movie with the idea that the
user is the main character. At the beginning of the game, the user will be asked to input the
name of its character and choose a class job. There are three class job options which the user
can choose from and each of them has distinct battle skills. Using the command feature of the
game, the user will be teleported to a dungeon where the monsters are located. The same with
other types of game, the difficulty of defeating the monster will increase as the level
progresses. Once all the monsters have been defeated the game will declare the user as a
winner, otherwise if the user’s character dies the game is over and the user shall be notified to
either play again or quit the game.

## Problem Statement
- Nowadays, the trend of the games could be very long and complicated to play so even if has the
best graphics some games could not be appealing to some players. Most of the players tend to
just quit without finishing the game. The idea of the game is to have an interactive game which
has a plot that will make them spend more time to eventually finish the goal of the game. The
application is intended for users to explore more the virtual world with full of enjoyment.
Simple yet entertaining is the key foundation of creating this type of game. 

## Target Audience
- The target audiences of this application are not limited by the gender or age. The application is
designed to be played not just one time but on a regular basis since this is a game with a movie-

- style plot. The application is user friendly and anyone who can comprehend a storyline and
could follow commands could play the game. The game is suited for players who are
who are bored and want a quick easy and fun role-playing game. It is good to have a game
wherein the player can assume the roles of their own character they play in a fictional setting.

# User Interaction and Experience

The application is classified as a Role Playing Game (RPG) wherein the player assumes the
roles of the character they play in a fictional setting. The goal of the game is to hunt and defeat
the monsters. The controls and features of the game are taught in an understandable story line
and sequence. The application includes a non-player character that is used to advance the story
line of the game. Through the command feature of the game, the player could also respond to
the speech displayed by the NPC.

The program will implement a feature that allows the user to input the name for its player. The
name has to be at least four characters long, otherwise the application will prompt the same
question. Another key feature of the game is the Job class selection. The game offers an
opportunity for the user to choose his desired Job for the character he opt to use. The game
provides three job options; 1=Swordsman, 2=Acolyte, and 3=Archer. The user has to select
from 1 to 3, however, if the user is unable to pick a number within that range, the game will not
proceed.

The application also implements a feature that will allow the user to select the skills for its
character. Each of the Job classification has particular and distinct set of skills and play style.
The user has to select between the two skills that are displayed. If the user is unable to pick a
number between one and two, the game will prompt the same options until the player pressed
the right option.

The other fun feature of the game is that it also allows the user to type commands. The
application will prompt the user to input a command in order to proceed.

1. Dungeon system – the user needs to type “@warp” in order to move to the dungeon
2.  Inventory system- the user needs to type “@items” in order for the player to access its

inventories, e. Apples to boost the HP
As a general rule, the application will display the same questions if the player press any other
keys or pick a different option that were not displayed the screen.
